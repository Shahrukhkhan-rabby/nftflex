# NFT Rental Marketplace

## **Overview**
The NFT Rental Marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to rent NFTs such as virtual real estate, gaming assets, or digital art for a specified period. Built using Python and ape, this project leverages blockchain technology to provide secure, automated rental agreements with innovative features to enhance user experience and maximize utility.

### **Understanding the Cycle of Your Smart Contract (`NFTFlex`)**
Your `NFTFlex` contract allows NFT owners to list their NFTs for rent, enabling renters to borrow them for a specified time. Here’s how the cycle works:

1. **Creating a Rental (By NFT Owner - Account 1)**
   - The owner of an NFT calls `createRental()` to list their NFT for rent.
   - They specify the NFT contract address, token ID, price per hour, whether the rental is fractional, collateral token address, and collateral amount.
   - This creates a rental entry in `s_rentals` and emits an event `NFTFlex__RentalCreated`.

2. **Renting an NFT (By Renter - Account 2)**
   - A user who wants to rent the NFT calls `rentNFT()` with the `rentalId` and `duration` (in hours).
   - They must send enough ETH (or ERC20 tokens) to cover both the rental fee and collateral.
   - If successful:
     - The `renter` field is updated to the caller’s address.
     - The rental start and end times are set.
     - The event `NFTFlex__RentalStarted` is emitted.
   - If anything is wrong (e.g., incorrect payment, already rented NFT, etc.), the function **reverts with an error**, which we can capture in the frontend.

3. **Ending the Rental (By Renter - Account 2)**
   - When the rental period is over, the renter calls `endRental()`.
   - The function checks:
     - The caller is the correct renter.
     - The rental period has ended.
   - If successful:
     - The renter’s collateral is refunded.
     - The rental is marked as available.
     - The event `NFTFlex__RentalEnded` is emitted.

4. **Withdrawing Earnings (By NFT Owner - Account 1)**
   - After a rental ends, the owner can call `withdrawEarnings()`.
   - The function checks:
     - The caller is the owner.
     - The rental has ended.
   - The contract transfers the rental fee (excluding collateral) to the owner.
   - The event `NFTFlex__EarningTransferFailed` is emitted if it fails.

### **Summary**
- **Account 1 (NFT Owner)**: Calls `createRental()` to list an NFT, later calls `withdrawEarnings()` to collect rent.
- **Account 2 (Renter)**: Calls `rentNFT()` to borrow an NFT, later calls `endRental()` to return it.
- **Account 3 (Another User)**: Can rent NFTs, interact with events, and observe state changes.

### **Frontend Features**
- **Error Handling**: Catches errors and displays them in Vue.js.
- **Event Listeners**: Listens for contract events to update UI in real-time.
- **Metamask Integration**: Allows users to interact with the contract via Metamask.
