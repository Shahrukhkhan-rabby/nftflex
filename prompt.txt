This is my smart contract, I have deployed successfully with python ape (test network):

```

```



Create a front-end using Vue.js for this. List all the NFT we have for rental, and Make sure to call rentNFT, withdrawEarnings, endRental properly.

And guide me to interact with this contract from front-end properly using ether js.
